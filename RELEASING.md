# Releasing InnoDI

This document is the single release source of truth for InnoDI.

Current stable public release target: `4.1.0`

## Release Checklist

Before tagging a release:

1. Update the matching `## <tag>` section in this file. The release workflow publishes that section as the GitHub Release body.
2. Confirm the README installation snippet points at the same tag.
3. Run the main package test suite:
   - `swift test`
4. Run the strict-concurrency suite:
   - `swift test -Xswiftc -strict-concurrency=complete -Xswiftc -warnings-as-errors`
5. Run example builds and tests:
   - `(cd Examples/SwiftUIExample && swift build && swift test)`
   - `(cd Examples/PreviewInjectionExample && swift build && swift test)`
6. Run the global DAG check:
   - `swift run InnoDI-DependencyGraph --root . --validate-dag`
7. Verify the macro-source `fatalError` allow-list is intact:
   - `Tools/check-no-fatalerror-in-macros.sh`
8. Generate DocC:
   - `Tools/generate-docc.sh`
9. Decide whether any artifact or schema contract changed and update the contract notes below.
10. Confirm the GitHub Actions `Release Gate` workflow is using the intended tag and toolchain.

## Release Notes Source

The tag-driven `Release Gate` workflow extracts the matching `## <tag>` section
from this file and uses it as the GitHub Release body.

Each version section should include:

- highlights
- breaking or behavior changes
- upgrade actions

## Artifact and Schema Contracts

These artifacts are treated as release-quality contracts:

- validation metrics JSON artifact
- validation summary Markdown artifact

Versioning rules:

- additive fields: minor schema increment or explicit release note
- changed semantics or removed fields: explicit schema bump plus upgrade note
- Markdown summaries do not carry a standalone numeric schema field; they follow the paired JSON artifact and the matching release section in this document

Current tracked versions:

- `ValidationMetricsArtifact.currentVersion`: see [ValidationMetrics.swift](Sources/InnoDIBuildSupport/ValidationMetrics.swift)
- `sharedRunCacheVersion`: see [ValidationCoordinator.swift](Sources/InnoDIBuildSupport/ValidationCoordinator.swift)

If artifact naming, schema shape, or coordinator cache salt changes, update
this document and the release-contract tests in the same change.

## Documentation Sync

Every release should leave these entrypoints consistent:

1. [README.md](README.md) and the localized README variants
2. [Overview.md](Sources/InnoDI/InnoDI.docc/Overview.md) and localized DocC source mirrors where present
3. [Validation.md](Sources/InnoDI/InnoDI.docc/Validation.md) and localized DocC source mirrors where present
4. [PolicyBoundaries.md](Sources/InnoDI/InnoDI.docc/PolicyBoundaries.md) and localized DocC source mirrors where present
5. [ModuleWideInitDetection.md](Sources/InnoDI/InnoDI.docc/ModuleWideInitDetection.md) and localized DocC source mirrors where present
6. [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md)

If a release changes user-facing validation, graph semantics, hierarchy
behavior, or SwiftUI integration, update those docs in the same change.

The repository keeps localized DocC Markdown mirrors for review and GitHub
reading. The generated DocC archive currently builds from the English base
catalog.

## Automated Release Artifacts

The release workflow publishes these assets to the GitHub Release:

- packaged DocC archive

Validation metrics and Markdown summaries remain release-quality contracts, but
they are produced as build and validation outputs rather than uploaded as
standalone release assets.

## 4.1.0

### Highlights

- **No more macro-synthesized `fatalError` traps in user code.** The five
  `fatalErrorGetter` sites in `ProvideMacro` that previously produced
  runtime-trapping accessors for malformed `@Provide` inputs now emit a
  build-time diagnostic and an empty expansion. Invalid input fails at
  build time, never at run time. The `internal.codegen-invariant`
  diagnostic remains available as a defense-in-depth signal for InnoDI
  contributor bugs but no longer pairs with a runtime trap.
- **Validation coordinator refuses unsafe filesystems.** A new
  `FilesystemTypeDetector` runs `statfs(2)` against the lock directory
  before any `O_CREAT | O_EXCL` and classifies the filesystem. NFS mounts,
  SMB/CIFS, WebDAV, and FUSE-style filesystems are blocked unless the
  operator explicitly opts in via `INNODI_ALLOW_UNSAFE_LOCK=1`.
  Unrecognized filesystems emit a single-line stderr warning and
  proceed.
- **Structured lock-timeout diagnostic.** When the coordinator times
  out waiting for the lock it now prints a multi-line block with the
  holder PID, holder age, boot ID (when known), recovered-stale flag,
  and four numbered remediation actions. The new
  [`lock-safety.md`](Sources/InnoDI/InnoDI.docc/lock-safety.md) DocC
  article documents the supported and unsupported filesystems, the
  diagnostic's fields, and the recovery procedure.
- **`InnoDI-DependencyGraph --diagnose-lock`.** New CLI subcommand
  that prints the coordinator's view of a scratch directory:
  filesystem class, environment overrides, and any lock files it
  discovers (with metadata). Designed for incident response when a
  build is stuck on `lock-contention-timeout`.
- **`InnoDI-DependencyGraph --cache-stats`.** New CLI subcommand
  that aggregates `validation-metrics.json` artifacts under a state
  directory into a single hit/miss table plus per-reason-code
  counts and per-file scan totals. Useful for CI environments
  whose cache rules look right on paper but never reuse work.
- **flock(2) advisory layer on the validation lock.** The
  coordinator now acquires `O_CREAT | O_EXCL` *and*
  `flock(LOCK_EX | LOCK_NB)` on the lock descriptor. The advisory
  layer is redundant on local filesystems and acts as defense-in-depth on
  filesystems with advisory-lock support, but it does not make NFS or other
  unsafe filesystems supported by default.
- **New `MigrationGuide.md` DocC article.** Reorganizes the
  per-release upgrade notes from `RELEASING.md` into a "what
  changes a consumer must do" article, covering 1.x → 4.0,
  4.0 → 4.1, 4.1 → 4.2 (planned), and 4.x → 5.0 (planned).
- **`@SubContainer` prefer-`with:` hint.** The new
  `sub.prefer-with-over-with-names` note diagnostic fires whenever
  `@SubContainer(... withNames: [...])` is used in isolation. The
  message includes the equivalent `with: [\.x]` form and ships with a
  Fix-it that performs the migration in place. The hint applies to
  the common single-peer-macro case where Swift's type-checker
  accepts key paths.

  **RFC 0002 status update**:
  [RFC 0002](docs/rfcs/0002-subcontainer-wiring-simplification.md) is
  now in `Deferred` status — the originally-planned 4.2 deprecation
  + 5.0 removal of `withNames:` cannot ship until an upstream Swift
  compiler limitation is resolved. When `@SubContainer` is stacked
  with another peer macro on the same property (`@DIFeatureRoot`,
  `@DIEnvironmentBridge`, …), every key-path spelling triggers
  `circular reference expanding peer macros`, and `withNames:` (the
  string form) is the only working escape hatch. The hint does not
  recommend migrating those sites.

### Breaking or Behavior Changes

- Malformed `@Provide(.transient)` (no factory, no typeExpr, no
  inline initializer) now produces only the existing
  `provide.transient-factory-required` diagnostic, plus a Swift
  compiler "stored property has no initial value" error from the
  property whose accessor was dropped. No `fatalError` reaches user
  code. Source-incompatible only for callers who relied on the
  runtime trap for unreachable cases.
- `@Provide(.transient, factory: { (_: T) in ... })` (wildcard
  closure parameters) and `@Provide` with an unknown scope behave
  the same way: terminal diagnostic + no synthesized accessor.
- The validation coordinator emits `ValidationReasonCode.unsafeFilesystem`
  in its metrics artifact when fail-fast triggers. Downstream tooling
  that parses metrics should add the new case.
- The lock-timeout stderr block format has changed. CI scripts that
  grep the previous one-line format (`Timed out waiting for
  validation coordinator lock at '...'`) should switch to the
  structured fields: `path:`, `waited:`, `Suggested actions:`.

### Upgrade Actions

- `@SubContainer(... withNames: [...])` consumers — for sites that
  are *not* stacked with another peer macro, apply the Fix-it
  offered alongside `sub.prefer-with-over-with-names` (or manually
  rewrite to `with: [\.x]`). For sites stacked with `@DIFeatureRoot`
  / `@DIEnvironmentBridge` / similar peer macros, leave them on
  `withNames:` — RFC 0002 is in `Deferred` status and `withNames:`
  remains the documented escape hatch for that combination.
- CI runners that mount the SPM scratch directory on NFS or SMB —
  redirect with `swift build --scratch-path /tmp/innodi-cache`, or
  set `INNODI_ALLOW_UNSAFE_LOCK=1` (the coordinator still emits a
  warning so the bypass is auditable).
- If you previously parsed the validation coordinator's lock
  timeout stderr, update the parser to read the structured fields
  documented in `lock-safety.md`.
- Downstream metrics consumers — handle
  `ValidationReasonCode.unsafeFilesystem`.

### Internal Notes

- `Sources/InnoDIMacros/SyntaxBuilders.swift` no longer exports
  `fatalErrorStmt`; the helper had a single caller (the
  now-eliminated `.none` scope path) and was removed.
- A new CI step (`Tools/check-no-fatalerror-in-macros.sh`)
  enforces the macro-source `fatalError` allow-list. Any future
  attempt to add a runtime trap to a macro-synthesized accessor
  will fail the macro-tests workflow until either the trap is
  removed or `docs/internal/fatalerror-inventory.md` and the
  allow-list are explicitly extended.
- The PR macro-tests workflow now runs the same strict-concurrency
  command as the tag release gate, and the release gate also runs the
  macro-source `fatalError` guard.
- A non-fatal SwiftSyntax/compiler-plugin JSON decode message can still
  appear during `swift test` package test-bundle builds. It does not fail
  the suite and is tracked separately in
  `docs/internal/macro-plugin-json-investigation.md`.

## 4.0.0

### Highlights

- Consolidates InnoDI's current public contract around macro-generated containers, strict validation, graph rendering, hierarchy validation, and SwiftUI integration.
- Ships `Lazy<T>`, `Provider<T>`, `@SubContainer`, `@DIComponent`, `@DIHierarchyRoot`, rooted graph rendering, and validation artifacts as the stable 4.0.0 baseline.
- `@SubContainer` adds explicit name-based same-name wiring via the new `withNames:` argument, and the macro now diagnoses ambiguous, conflicting, or unparseable wiring (`with:` + `withNames:` conflict, same-name wiring + `bindings:` conflict, non-literal arrays, parent-name-collision when inferred wiring is ambiguous).
- Standardizes documentation around localized README and DocC entrypoints while treating this file as the single release and upgrade record.

### Breaking or Behavior Changes

- `@DIContainer(root:)` is a graph-rendering entry flag only. When at least one root exists, Mermaid, DOT, and ASCII output is pruned to the union of root-reachable nodes and edges.
- `validateDAG: false` skips global DAG validation plus the macro's local cycle and closure/`with:` graph-derived diagnostics, but raw-expression `factory:` and initializer references still diagnose at compile time and structural validation still runs.
- All containers synthesize `Overrides` scaffolding unless the user declares a nested `Overrides` type. Input-only containers therefore keep an empty builder and support no-op child override forwarding.
- `Lazy<T>` and `Provider<T>` are intentionally non-`Sendable` deferred handles and must stay on the container's original isolation domain.
- `Provider<T>` is limited to `.transient` targets.
- The previously public `_LazyCell<T>` runtime helper is removed. The macro now emits a local `_InnoDIDeferredCell<T>` inside synthesized initializers; downstream code should not depend on either symbol.
- `@SubContainer` implicit same-name wiring is only blessed when the parent has zero or one `@Provide` candidate. Larger parents must opt into `with:`, `withNames:`, or `bindings:`. `with: []` and `withNames: []` are explicit empty subsets that call `Child()`.
- `@SubContainer(with:)` / `withNames:` must be literal arrays the macro can read; runtime variables and computed elements are now rejected with `sub.invalid-same-name-wiring`.
- New diagnostics: `sub.with-conflicts-with-with-names`, `sub.bindings-conflicts-with-with`, `sub.invalid-same-name-wiring`, `container.reserved-name-prefix`. Build-support adds `hierarchy.unknown-child-input` for extras forwarded via `with:`/`withNames:`/`bindings:`.

### Upgrade Actions

- If you parse dependency graph payloads programmatically, support `isSoft`, `isProvider`, and `isOwnership`.
- If you relied on the old release-note flow, update internal tooling to read version sections from this file instead of legacy release-note files.
- If your tooling referenced older internal source paths, re-point it at the split macro and build-support file layout introduced before 4.0.0.
- If your module also defines `Lazy<T>` or `Provider<T>`, prefer spelling deferred wrapper parameters as `InnoDI.Lazy<T>` and `InnoDI.Provider<T>`.
- If you imported `_LazyCell` from InnoDI runtime, remove that import — the helper is now inlined per macro expansion and is no longer part of the public surface.
- If a container declares a member whose name starts with `_storage_`, `_override_sub_`, `_innoDISubBuild_`, `_innoDIUnresolvedDependency`, `_subBuildCell_`, `_lazyCell_`, or `_lazySelfForSub`, rename it. The macro now flags these reserved prefixes via `container.reserved-name-prefix`.
- New `InnoDICore` parsing helpers added to support strict literal-array validation: `parseStrictKeyPathArrayArgument`, `parseStrictStringArrayArgument`, `parseSubContainerBindingsArgument`, plus the supporting `SubContainerSameNameWiringLabel`, `SubContainerSameNameWiringParseState`, and `SubContainerBindingArgument` types and the new `hasWithDependencies` / `hasWithNamesDependencies` / `sameNameWiring` fields on `SubContainerAttributeInfo`. The non-strict `parseStringArrayArgument` was removed; migrate to the strict variant.
